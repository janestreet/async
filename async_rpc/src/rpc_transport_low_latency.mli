  (** - [max_message_size] is the maximum message size a reader/writer will accept to
      receive/send.

      - [max_buffer_size] is the maximum size the internal reader/writer's buffer will
        ever grow.

      - [write_timeout] is the maximum time allowed for a write operation to complete
        before an error is reported.

      - When the writer's internal buffer is filled at [buffering_threshold_in_bytes] or
        more, the writer will try to flush its buffer immediately. This is to get good
        latency and avoid buffering too much when sending big batches of messages.

      - If the application hasn't sent any messages in the current Async job and nothing
        is buffered, the first [start_batching_after_num_messages] messages will be sent
        immediately. After that the writer will start buffering. This is to give good
        latency when the application sends a few messages occasionally but still get good
        throughput when sending a batch of messages.

      Note that [start_batching_after_num_messages] and [buffering_threshold_in_bytes]
      have somewhat opposite meanings: the former determines when to start batching and
      the latter determines when to write data that has been batched.

(** All the following [create] functions take a [max_message_size] argument in addition to
    a [Config.t]. The final [max_message_size] will be the min of both.

    The rationale for this is that [max_message_size] is more a property of the protocol
    and should be specified by the programmer, while other configuration parameters are
    for tuning purposes.

        into the transport's internal buffer. After
        [peek_available_without_buffering_from_socket] is complete, any other code that
        reads from the socket will see the bytes that were peeked here.

        It doesn't wait for [len] number of bytes to appear; hence [_once_] in the name.
        As soon as there's any data available on the socket, it tries to peek [len] bytes.
        If the available bytes is less than [len] then it returns [`Not_enough_data]. *)
